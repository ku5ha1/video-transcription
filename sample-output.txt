[00:00:00] Speaker 1: "So, first of all, can you tell us in simple terms what RAG is and why is it important" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:00:06] Speaker 2: "in the development of AI systems?" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:00:09] Speaker 1: "Right, let me start by full form of the RAG." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:00:14] Speaker 2: "It's retrieval augmented generation, so now I'll break down each part of the RAG." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:00:19] Speaker 1: "Retrieval augmented generation and explain you in very simple words of what it is," [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Confident]
[00:00:24] Speaker 2: "but just to give you a quick context," [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:00:28] Speaker 1: "algorithms, large language models are all those models which we interact every day in our life." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:00:36] Speaker 2: "I mean, these days it has become very integral part of our life, so we interact with" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Confident]
[00:00:41] Speaker 1: "Ellam Staley, but the way they were trained was on a vast amount of data that was available" [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Professional]
[00:00:47] Speaker 2: "on the internet. So, no specific data. So, it is basically jack-off-world traits and master of none." [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Hesitant]
[00:00:54] Speaker 1: "That is Ellam's basically. So, when you ask Ellam a very specific question about a domain," [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:01] Speaker 2: "let's say healthcare, you ask it benefits of an XYZ medicine. It might or it might not be able to answer" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:09] Speaker 1: "it to you because it is not trained based on that specific domain, right? However, Ellam still tries" [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Hesitant]
[00:01:16] Speaker 2: "to answer your question and now because it doesn't have a proper knowledge about it," [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:21] Speaker 1: "it would hallucinate and make up some answer for you just to satisfy your query." [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:29] Speaker 2: "And drag what we do is that we retrieve the relevant chunk of data. For example," [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:36] Speaker 1: "let me continue with the previous example, a user asked what are the benefits of XYZ medicine." [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:42] Speaker 2: "Now, we would have stored that benefits somewhere in the database." [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:48] Speaker 1: "Based on the question of the user, we would retrieve the relevant chunk. So, this relevant" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:53] Speaker 2: "chunk would have the information of the benefits of the medicine. So, first thing was retrieval." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:01:59] Speaker 1: "Now, since we have the retrieved chunk that has the answer of the user and we have the" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:05] Speaker 2: "question of the user, we would augment both of these in a prompt template. So, the retrieval" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:11] Speaker 1: "will retrieve the content and augmentation. So, we augment it, the content with the" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:17] Speaker 2: "question of the user. So, retrieval augmented generation. So, third part is generation." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:23] Speaker 1: "Now, since we have augmented both of these things, we would pass both of these things to an" [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:28] Speaker 2: "Ellam. Now, the Ellam has more context on what are the actual benefits of the medicine." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:36] Speaker 1: "An Ellam would be able to craft a specific response for the user." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Professional]
[00:02:42] Speaker 2: "Basically, user can also go to the website and read the benefits." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:49] Speaker 1: "But then, when we send this information to Ellam along with the question of the user," [Emotion: Confusion, Tone: Inquisitive]
[00:02:54] Speaker 2: "the Ellam would be able to address the specific issue that user asked." [Emotion: Interest, Tone: Inquisitive]
